This Python module can be used to communicate with a \href{http://www.mini-box.com/DCDC-USB-200}{\tt Mini\+Box D\+C\+D\+C-\/\+U\+S\+B-\/200} intelligent D\+C-\/\+DC converter (or other Mini\+Box converters) over a U\+SB connection. This allows for status monitoring and configuration of paramters of the module.

It uses the Python \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html}{\tt {\ttfamily ctypes}} module to wrap a Windows D\+LL in pure Python and allow functions in the D\+LL to be called.

\subsection*{How to Use}

{\bfseries Note\+: this class only works with x86 (32-\/bit) versions of the Python interpreter -\/ the D\+C\+D\+C\+Usb\+Lib dll is compiled for 32-\/bit platforms only.}

{\bfseries Note 2\+: I have only tested this with Python 3.\+6.\+1 -\/ it may work with 2.\+7 or other versions.}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Ensure you clone the \textquotesingle{}D\+LL\textquotesingle{} folder along with the Dc\+Dc\+Converter.\+py class file itself. This folder contains the D\+C\+D\+C\+Usb\+Lib.\+dll provided by Mini\+Box which packages the functions used to communicate with the module. In addition, it also contains some Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 re-\/distributables which are required by D\+C\+D\+C\+Usb\+Lib.\+dll. These can also be installed as standard system libraries by installing the \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387}{\tt Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package}.

The \textquotesingle{}D\+LL\textquotesingle{} folder {\bfseries must} exist in the same directory as the module file -\/ that is where the module looks when it is imported for the first time.
\item Import the module in the Python program which requires it using\+: {\ttfamily import \hyperlink{namespace_dc_dc_converter}{Dc\+Dc\+Converter}}

This loads the D\+LL into memory and makes it available for use by the class when it is initialised.
\item Initialise the class using {\ttfamily Example\+Converter\+Name = Dc\+Dc\+Converter(devcount, timer, timeout)}

Where\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily devcount} is the number of the device you want to connect to -\/ use when multiple D\+C\+D\+C-\/\+U\+S\+B-\/200s are connected.
\item {\ttfamily timer} is the D\+C\+D\+C\+Usb\+Lib A\+PI refresh rate in {\bfseries seconds} -\/ ie. how often it refreses the data returned by the {\ttfamily Get\+X\+X\+X()} functions.
\item {\ttfamily timeout} is the time in seconds that should carry on trying to detect a device for, if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t detect one at first.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Documentation of available functions is provided within the class itself.

{\bfseries Note\+:} If the module is executed by itself (ie. as \+\_\+\+\_\+main\+\_\+\+\_\+), it will run a small test program which establishes connection with a D\+C\+D\+C-\/\+U\+S\+B-\/200 and prints out its Windows device path and firmware version.
